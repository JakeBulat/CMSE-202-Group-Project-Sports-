Ethan - I was responsible for adjusting a dataset from kaggle so that it sorted the stats out by each quarterback. I also used a querey to sort through the data to eliminate seasons where the quarteback didn't throw very many passes, either due to being a backup, or injured. This was completed by using a group by command to sort through the data and using a querey command to remove the undesired rows from the sorted dataset.
